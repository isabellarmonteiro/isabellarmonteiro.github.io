### Teaching

#### Academic
In 2020, I had the rewarding opportunity of being the teaching assistant for PUC-Rio's undergraduate Development Economics course during two academic semesters. Each semester, I gave weekly lectures to approximately 70 students with the objective of deepening their knowledge of the literature and their ability to apply the economic development theories in practice.

<br> <br>

#### Public Sector
During that same year, I also became a teaching assistant for two capacity building courses aimed at strenghtening the implementation capacity of public servants in Brazil. The first course was given to teams within different departments of Rio de Janeiro's City Hall, while the second one was given to teams working at the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).

### Animated Videos

In 2021, I created my first animated project: a promotional video for the capacity building courses that we were giving to public servants in Rio de Janeiro's city hall. The story focuses on the Tanager's important role as a seed spreader in spite of his small size, highlighting how the small and medium-scale projects that our students were developing would eventually translate into larger-scale change in Rio de Janeiro's status quo.
